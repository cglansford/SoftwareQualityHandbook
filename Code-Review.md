# **Code Review**


## **Introduction into Coding Standards**

An effective peer review process involves balancing strictly documented processes and a collaborative work environment. 
Decidedly rigid peer code reviews can slow and restrain productivity however, lazy code reviews can often prove to be a vain exercise. 
Managers or team leaders are responsible for locating the happy medium between them this will allow the peer review to operate optimally while creating open communication and knowledge exchange between peers and teammates.

**Bad Practices**

- Seniority doesn't mean always right. During code review everyone's opinion counts the same and everyone should be open to the same scrutiny. This means that team leaders shouldn't ever declare that their way is the best and that their work is beyond contestation.

- Inconsistency across different reviewers allows the reviewers to insert bias and personal opinion to mediate this there should be a clear definition of what counts as good code and what counts as bad code. That way personal preference and styling choices don't influence the result as when responding to reviews workers moral will be lowered if they feel that they can't work in an inclusive environment. Developers will begin to feel that the code review is a waste of time and not worth doing.

- Style Issues unless egregious should maintain a general view of the project and should be picked apart although this sounds contradictory to previous point the style should be consistent however reviewers shouldn't nit-pick at style issues unless they are a breach of the rules of good code that are stated.

- Don't make reviews personal. Reviewers should alienate the author of the code before reviewing whether the author be themselves or other people's work only judge and review the code and don't immediately assume good or bad workload from others leave the personal at the door when it comes to reviewing.

Initial code enters review process → Reviewed code→ Author makes changes → Code re-reviewed → if code doesn't meet requirements → code re-reviewed → once code is accepted code merged.
