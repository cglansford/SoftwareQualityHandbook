# Coding Standards

## Introduction

### Coding standards could be defined as a set of industry norms, best practices or general software development etiquette. These traditions of course vary depending on your particular organisation but in this handbook we will try to identify the most crucial practices every software developer should know. How do we decide on which practices to implement and which to leave out? We donâ€™t want too much red tape slowing down development and causing frustration within our team. We will outline some of the practices we wish to implement below.


## Naming Conventions

I believe no matter the level of a programmer, be it academic or professional, having appropriate names for variables, functions and classes is essential. These conventions can be derived from common sense or from a company handbook once it makes sense to you and whoever you need to show your code to, especially if they need to work on it.

Reliable and consistent naming can eliminate the need for large sections of comments in your code. Comments in our code should ideally be there to enhance the readers experience, not for them to generate their understanding of the code from.


## What is considered good practice?

1. Distinguishing variables, functions and classes with different naming conventions.
2. Whatever conventions you choose even regarding whitespacing and tabbing, it must be consistent.
3. Liberal use of concise comments.
