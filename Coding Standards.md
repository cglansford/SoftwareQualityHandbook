# Coding Standards

## Introduction

 Coding standards could be defined as a set of industry norms, best practices or general software development etiquette. These traditions of course vary depending on your particular organisation but in this handbook we will try to identify the most crucial practices every software developer should know. How do we decide on which practices to implement and which to leave out? We don’t want too much red tape slowing down development and causing frustration within our team. We will outline some of the practices we wish to implement below.


# Naming Conventions

I believe no matter the level of a programmer, be it academic or professional, having appropriate names for variables, functions and classes is essential. These conventions can be derived from common sense or from a company handbook once it makes sense to you and whoever you need to show your code to, especially if they need to work on it.

Reliable and consistent naming can eliminate the need for large sections of comments in your code. Comments in our code should ideally be there to enhance the readers experience, not for them to generate their understanding of the code from.


## What is considered good practice?

1. Distinguishing variables, functions and classes with different naming conventions.
2. Whatever conventions you choose even regarding whitespacing and tabbing, it must be consistent.
3. Liberal use of concise comments.

## Benefits of good naming conventions

1. Greatly increased code readability, especially for third parties.
2. Promotes organisation wide consistency.
3. Avoids naming conflicts, especially when collaboration is involved.
4. Makes everyones lives 100 times easier, reduces conflict. 

# Back ups

It is almost impossible to predict where things will go wrong. Files can get corrupted, batteries can die, software and hardware can fail us. Any data loss due to these factors no matter how small can be extremely detrimental. It can cause stress, loss of time and money. Having good standards in terms of regular back ups can help to mitigate this damage. Depending on your solution for this it also comes with aspects of data security. Your data will be extremely safe and encrypted in cloud based solutions. Having your data stored off site can be very important in the event of something like a ransomware attack.

What is considered best practice?

1. Daily back ups, preferably to a cloud based solution.
2. Schedule and automate backups as much as possible.
3. Encrypt backups and be security conscious.
4. Comply with any retention or GDPR requirements.
