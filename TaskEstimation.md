# Task Estimation In Scrum

The main purpose of task estimation in scrum is to give a general understanding of the size, timeline and costs incurred for a project. They are essential in the agile development process and specifically for software development teams who need to deliver reliable advances at regular intervals. 


## How to estimate tasks in scrum

	
Tasks can be estimated using story points to represent the estimated amount of time required for each task required, known as user stories. Each story point can be given a value, usually an hour or a day to then estimate and break down the overall time required for a scrum project.

The customer, whether the company or an external customer, reads the stories created then the team will be able to estimate the effort required for each user story. Then after team discussions, further changes can be made until an agreed plan is set.

Calculating estimates for scrum tasks involves aligning the main priorities of the project based on the timelines and costs expected. Choosing the best options is important to ensure improvements of accuracy so that the team is always on track to meet their sprint goals.

## Why To Estimate Tasks
1. To get people liable for their work
2. To predict the finish line
3. To fill up the sprint with work
4. To measure teams’ progress we do estimation

## Planning Poker

Story points are usually aligned with the Fibonacci sequence which uses a number sequence where the numbers are the sum of the previous two.The sequence goes like this: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc. This technique is called Scrum Planning Poker where the Scrum team works to create accurate estimates. However, in planning poker, estimates are not completed using time estimates because a story point is an abstract measurement of time set by the team.

## Bucket System

Much quicker than planning poker is the Bucket System. This system is a decent substitute when estimating a large number of items with a large group of participants quickly. Different buckets are created with values: 0,1,2,3,4,5,8,13,20,30,50,100, 200. The stories need to be placed within these where the estimator finds them suitable. The group estimates the items by placing them in these “buckets”. Buckets are usually different sheets of brown paper where you can place the sticky note with the item. But you can also use actual baskets to limit discussion about already processed items.

# Bad Practices in task estimation for scrum projects 

## Constant re-estimation of tasks
Team members re-estimate the time left on their current task daily, depending on how fast they are making progress. If they feel they have a lot of time left on a task when they are making significant progress ahead of estimates, they may reduce the time they feel it would take. Running into problems towards the end of a task can then result in requiring an extension. This should be avoided at all costs.

## Ensure high priority tasks are completed
In stressful situations team members may get caught up in stories that are not essential. This can result in high priority tasks not being completed and have long lasting effects on the projects completion time
